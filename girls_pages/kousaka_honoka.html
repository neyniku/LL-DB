                <h1>Chika Takami</h1>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p1>is the primary protagonist in Love Live! Sunshine!!. 
                    
                    She was a second year student at Uranohoshi Girls' High School prior to its closure and is currently a third year student at Numazu High School, being temporarily integrated at Seishin High School before the former's opening. She is the leader of CYaRon!, a sub-unit under Aqours and is the leader and founder of the group. Her image color is mikan orange.</p1>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p1>Chika is the second year student at Uranohoshi Girls' High School who launched Aqours. She is the youngest of three sisters and comes from a family with a ryokan known for its open-air, ocean-view hot springs. She is neighbors with former Otonokizaka first year student Riko Sakurauchi and is childhood friends with Kanan Matsuura and You Watanabe.

                Chika's elder sisters are Shima and Mito. According to magazine material, her sisters are also fans of μ's, though this does not seem to have been retained in the anime adaptation. They also own a large dog named Shiitake.
                    
                In the first episode, on a trip to Tokyo with You, the two learned about school idols and the Love Live! tournament after seeing a screen with school idols at the Akiba Dome, including µ's. She becomes fascinated with the idea of school idols, so she decides to start, with You, a school idol club of their own at their high school.</p1>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p1>Chika is very energetic, goofy, sociable and has a very strong sense of perseverance. The latter point is especially notable, as it is shown multiple times in the anime, such as when she kept on trying to persuade the school council president, Dia Kurosawa, to let the School Idol Club be approved. Her positive, can-do attitude gradually begins to affect everyone around her as well as the anime progresses. Her energetic and perseverant nature also makes her rather impatient and easy to tease about giving up, only to make her even more perseverant on achieving her goal.

                Due to her usual positive nature, however, she tends to hide her more sensitive side, and tries hard not to cry when she is sad or frustrated, as she feels it would drag down others' morale if they were to see her feeling sad. This can be seen during Season 1 Episode 8, when she is deeply frustrated on the inside after Aqours' disappointing performance compared to the other school idol groups.
                    
                Chika heavily dislikes when her friends get into confrontations she deems petty, being one of the very few things that can anger her. This can be seen in Season 1 Episode 9, where she mediates a dispute between Kanan and Mari after a nervous Dia is unable to calm things down. She loves and treasures the friendships she's made throughout her years at school, especially with You, who has been her childhood friend. Since Riko moved to Uchiura, however, Chika becomes very interested in befriending her new fellow second year. Season 1 Episode 11 eventually culminates with this on her and Riko comforting a jealous You about this. On the other hand, she's not above making snide, deadpan expressions whenever one of her friends is acting strange, such as with Yoshiko.
                    
                In one of the audio dramas, it is revealed Chika not only has a habit making puns, but of explaining them without being asked as well.</p1>
